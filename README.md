# Ethical Hacking Lab Setup Using VirtualBox

## Overview
Setting up an ethical hacking lab is essential for practicing cybersecurity techniques in a safe and controlled environment. This guide provides step-by-step instructions to configure a virtual lab using VirtualBox, a lightweight Windows 10 Superlite Ghost ISO, and essential ethical hacking tools.

## System Requirements
Before proceeding with the setup, ensure that your system meets the following minimum requirements:

- **Operating System (Host):** Windows, Linux, or macOS
- **RAM:** 8GB or more
- **Storage:** Minimum of 20GB free space
- **Required Software:**
  - VirtualBox
  - Windows 10 Superlite Ghost ISO
  - VirtualBox Guest Additions
  - Ethical hacking tools (accessible via a shared folder)

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Download Required Files
1. Download and install **VirtualBox** from the official website: [VirtualBox Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
2. Obtain the **Windows 10 Superlite Compact Ghost ISO** from a trusted source such as [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/ghost-spectre-windows-10).
3. Download the **VirtualBox Guest Additions** from the official VirtualBox documentation: [Guest Additions](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html).
4. Collect all necessary ethical hacking tools and store them in a designated folder (e.g., "Lab Setup").

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Machine
1. Open VirtualBox and click on **New** to create a new virtual machine.
2. Set a name (e.g., "EthicalHackingLab"), select **Type:** Microsoft Windows, and choose **Version:** Windows 10 (64-bit).
3. Allocate at least **4GB RAM** to the virtual machine.
4. Create a **Virtual Hard Disk** with a recommended size of **20GB or more**.
5. Attach the downloaded **Windows 10 Superlite Ghost ISO** as the boot disk and proceed with the installation.

### Step 3: Install VirtualBox Guest Additions
1. Once Windows is installed, navigate to **Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD Image** in VirtualBox.
2. Open the virtual CD drive in the VM and run **VBoxWindowsAdditions.exe**.
3. Follow the installation prompts and restart the VM after completion.

### Step 4: Configure Shared Folder for Hacking Tools
1. In VirtualBox, go to **Settings > Shared Folders**.
2. Click **Add New Folder**, select the "Lab Setup" folder, and enable **Auto-mount**.
3. Start the virtual machine and access the shared folder from **File Explorer**.

### Step 5: Install Ethical Hacking Tools
Install the required tools from the shared folder, including but not limited to:

- **Python** (for scripting and automation)
- **Java** (for application testing)
- **MySQL** (for database security testing)
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**
- **Notepad++** (for coding and scripting)
- **Web Browsers** (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox)
- **Penetration Testing Tools** (Kali tools, Wireshark, etc.)

## Conclusion
By following this guide, you will have a fully functional ethical hacking lab set up on VirtualBox, allowing you to test security techniques and conduct penetration testing safely. Always use these tools responsibly and ethically.
